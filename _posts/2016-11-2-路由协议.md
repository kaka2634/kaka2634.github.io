# Ad hoc protocol



## Issue

1. **Mobility**

   Dynamic topology

2. **Bandwidth constraint**

   In wireless network, the radio hand is limited, and hence the data rates it can offer are much less  than what a wired network can offer. This requires that the routing protocols use the bandwidth optimally by keeping the overhead as low as possible.

   The limited bandwidth availability also imposes a constraint on routing protocols in maintaining the topological information. Due to the frequent changes in topology, maintaining a  consistent topological information at all the nodes involves more control overhead which, in turn, results in more bandwidth wastage.

   Wired networks may not be suitable for the wireless networking environment.

3. **Error-Prone Shared Broadcast Radio Channel**

   It is required that ad hoc wireless network routing protocols find paths with less congestion.

4. **Hidden and Exposed Terminal Problem**

   The hidden terminal problem refers to the collision of packets at a receiving node due to the simultaneous transmission of those nodes that are not with the direct transmission range of the sender, but are within the transmission range of the receiver. Collision occurs when both nodes transmit packets at the same time without knowing about the transmission of each other.Solution for this problem include medium access collision avoidance( MACA )--CTS-RTS  , medium access collision avoidance for wireless( MACAW) --CTS-RTS-DATA-ACK(also may have hidden problem is one node transfer not clearly), florr acquisition multiple access( FAMA ) and dual busy tone multiple access ( DBTMA ).

   ** Noted that the hidden is because A->C,B->C, A,B don't know each other transmit, so A hidden B or B hidden A. **

   The exposed terminal problem refer to the inability of a  node which is blocked due to transmission by a nearby transmitting node to transmit to another node.(should not interfere with the nearby on-going transmission).SO it  should use different frequency. 

5. **Resource Constrains**

   battery restrict the power source.

## Classification of routing protocols

#### Based on the Routing Information Update Mechanism

1. Proactive or table-driven routing protocols

2. Reactive or on-demand routing protocols

3. Hybrid routing protocols

#### Based on the Use of Temporal information for Routing

1. Using past temporal information

2. Using future temporal information


#### Based on the Routing Topolgy

1. Flat topology routing protocols

2. Hierarchical topology routing protocols


#### Based on the Utilization of Specific Resources

1. Power-aware routing
2. Geographical information assisted routing

## Table-driven routing protocols
#### Destination Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing Protocol
Bellman-Ford algorithm
maintains a table that contains the shortest distance and the first node on the shortest path to every other node in the network.
add sequence number tags make the existing wired network protocol can be apllied to ad hoc network.
#### Wireless Routing Protocol
inherits the properties of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm
use a set of tables to maintain more accurate information: distance table, routing table, link cost table and a message retransmission list.
faster converge and involve fewer table updates
complexity of mantain of mutiple tables
#### Cluster-Head Gateway Swith Routing Protocol
organizes the nodes into clusters
least cluster change (LCC) algotithm
source->cluster head->cluster gateway->cluster head->destination
hierarchical routing enable better bandwidth utilization possible. The main problem is it increase in path length an instability in the system at high mobility when the rate of change of cluster head is high.
#### Source-Tree Adaptive Routing Protocol
Least overhead routing aproach (LORA) as the key concept rather than the optimum routing approach (ORA) that was employed by earlier table-driven routing protocols.
LORA attempts to provide feasible paths that are not guaranteed to be optimal, but involve much less control overhead.(overhead 开销)

## On-Demand routing protocols
#### Dynamic Source Routing Protocol
RouteRequest, RouteReply
